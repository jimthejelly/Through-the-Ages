        <h3 class="ending-headings">STORY</h3>
        <p>After a catastrophic destruction that killed everyone in the year 2050,
            you were chosen as the designated time traveller to save the planet.
            While travelling back in time to stop the past, your time machine malfunctions,
            and you are sent to the very beginning of time! Now, your actions will
            dictate whether the world will even live to see 2050. Good luck soldier.
            We are counting on you.</p>

        <br>

        <h3 class="ending-headings">HOW TO PLAY</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Control time and space itself and see how the world progressed through time!</li>
            <li>Occasionally, "crises" will appear in your dashboard, and you will need
                to make a choice on how to proceed in order to progress forward in time. Be
                careful! Your choices will determine what the next phase of the world will
                look like.</li>
            <li>You will be unable to proceed through to the next time until you have made a
                decision. You can always go back in time to change your previous decisions,
                however.</li>
        </ul>
